<h1> The Wall </h1>
<h2> Made in 1979 </h2>
<p> this was written by Roger Walter and a movie was made by it. The album has not been played again because he had left the band and owned the rights to the song.</p>
<p> This album was one of Pink Floyds last songs before the final cut were Roger left the band. This is also about his childhood and post war drama because his dad died in the 2nd world war.</p>
